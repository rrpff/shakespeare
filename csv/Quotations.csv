34085446	Fires the proud tops of the eastern pines.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085447	Not all the water in the rough rude sea<br>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085448	O, call back yesterday, bid time return!	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085449	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085450	And nothing can we call our own but death<br>And that small model of the barren earth<br>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.<br>For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground<br>And tell sad stories of the death of kings.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085451	Comes at the last, and with a little pin<br>Bores through his castle wallùand farewell king!	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085452	He is come to open<br>The purple testament of bleeding war.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 3
34085453	And my large kingdom for a little grave,<br>A little little grave, an obscure grave.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act III Scene 3
34085454	Gave<br>His body to that pleasant country's earth,<br>And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,<br>Under whose colours he had fought so long.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085455	A mockery king of snow.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085456	As in a theatre, the eyes of men,<br>After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,<br>Are idly bent on him that enters next,<br>Thinking his prattle to be tedious.	<i>King Richard II</i>, Act V Scene 2

34085470	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,<br>He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,<br>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<br>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.	<i>King Henry IV. Part I</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085471	God save the mark.	<i>King Henry IV. Part I</i>, Act I Scene 3

34085834	For Brutus is an honourable man;<br>So are they all, all honourable men.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085835	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085836	O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>And men have lost their reason.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085837	But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br>Have stood against the world; now lies he there,<br>And none so poor to do him reverence.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085838	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085839	See what a rent the envious Casca made.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085840	This was the most unkindest cut of all.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085841	Great Caesar fell.<br>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085842	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085843	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<br>I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br>But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085844	I only speak right on.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085845	Put a tongue<br>In every wound of Caesar that should move<br>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085846	When love begins to sicken and decay,<br>It useth an enforced ceremony.<br>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34085847	You yourself<br>Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085848	The foremost man of all this world.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085849	I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,<br>Than such a Roman.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085850	I said, an elder soldier, not a better:<br>Did I say "better"?	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085851	There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br>For I am arm'd so strong in honesty<br>That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br>Which I respect not.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085852	Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?<br>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<br>To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<br>Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts:<br>Dash him to pieces!	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085853	A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,<br>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085854	All his faults observed,<br>Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085855	There is a tide in the affairs of men<br>Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br>Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085856	We must take the current when it serves,<br>Or lose our ventures.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085857	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<br>And nature must obey necessity.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085858	Brutus. Then I shall see thee again?<br>Ghost. Ay, at Philippi.<br>Brutus. Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34085859	But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,<br>And leave them honeyless.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act V Scene 1
34085860	Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!<br>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;<br>If not, why then this parting was well made.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act V Scene 1
34085861	O, that a man might know<br>The end of this day's business ere it come!	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act V Scene 1
34085862	The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act V Scene 3
34085863	This was the noblest Roman of them all.	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act V Scene 5
34085864	His life was gentle, and the elements<br>So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up<br>And say to all the world, "This was a man!"	<i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act V Scene 5
34085865	1 W. When shall we three meet again<br>In thunder, lightning, or in rain?<br>2 W. When the hurlyburly's done,<br>When the battle's lost and won.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085866	Fair is foul, and foul is fair.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085867	Banners flout the sky.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085868	Sleep shall neither night nor day<br>Hang upon his pent-house lid.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085869	Dwindle, peak, and pine.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085870	What are these<br>So wither'd and so wild in their attire,<br>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,<br>And yet are on't?	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085871	If you can look into the seeds of time,<br>And say which grain will grow and which will not.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085872	Stands not within the prospect of belief.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085873	The earth hath bubbles as the water has,<br>And these are of them.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085874	The insane root<br>That takes the reason prisoner.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085875	And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,<br>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,<br>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's<br>In deepest consequence.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085876	Two truths are told,<br>As happy prologues to the swelling act<br>Of the imperial theme.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085877	And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,<br>Against the use of nature. Present fears<br>Are less than horrible imaginings.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085878	Nothing is<br>But what is not.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085879	If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085880	Come what come may,<br>Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 3
34085881	Nothing in his life<br>Became him like the leaving it; he died<br>As one that had been studied in his death<br>To throw away the dearest thing he owed,<br>As't were a careless trifle.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 4
34085882	There's no art<br>To find the mind's construction in the face.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 4
34085883	More is thy due than more than all can pay.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 4
34085884	Yet do I fear thy nature;<br>It is too full o' the milk of human kindness.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 5
34085885	What thou wouldst highly,<br>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,<br>And yet wouldst wrongly win.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 5
34085886	That no compunctious visitings of nature<br>Shake my fell purpose.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 5
34085887	Your face, my thane, is as a book where men<br>May read strange matters. To beguile the time,<br>Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,<br>Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,<br>But be the serpent under't.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 5
34085888	Which shall to all our nights and days to come<br>Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 5
34085889	This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air<br>Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself<br>Unto our gentle senses.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 6
34085890	The heaven's breath<br>Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,<br>Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird<br>Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:<br>Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,<br>The air is delicate.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 6
34085891	If it were done when't is done, then't were well<br>It were done quickly: if the assassination<br>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch<br>With his surcease success; that but this blow<br>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,<br>But	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085892	Besides, this Duncan<br>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been<br>So clear in his great office, that his virtues<br>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against<br>The deep damnation of his taking-off;<br>And pity, like a naked new-born babe,	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085893	I have bought<br>Golden opinions from all sorts of people.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085894	Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"<br>Like the poor cat i' the adage.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085895	I dare do all that may become a man;<br>Who dares do more is none.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085896	Nor time nor place<br>Did then adhere.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085897	Macb. If we should fail?<br>Lady M. We fail!<br>But screw your courage to the sticking-place,<br>And we'll not fail.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085898	Memory, the warder of the brain.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act I Scene 7
34085899	There's husbandry in heaven;<br>Their candles are all out.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085900	Shut up<br>In measureless content.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085901	Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br>The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085902	Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085903	Now o'er the one half-world<br>Nature seems dead.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085904	Thou sure and firm-set earth,<br>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<br>Thy very stones prate of my whereabout.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085905	The bell invites me.<br>Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell<br>That summons thee to heaven or to hell.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 1
34085906	It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,<br>Which gives the stern'st good-night.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 2
34085907	The attempt and not the deed<br>Confounds us.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 2
34085908	I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"<br>Stuck in my throat.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 2
34085909	Infirm of purpose!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 2
34085910	'T is the eye of childhood<br>That fears a painted devil.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 2
34085911	Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood<br>Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather<br>The multitudinous seas incarnadine,<br>Making the green one red.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 2
34085912	The labour we delight in physics pain.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085913	Dire combustion and confused events<br>New hatch'd to the woful time.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085914	Tongue nor heart<br>Cannot conceive nor name thee!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085915	Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!<br>Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope<br>The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence<br>The life o' the building!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085916	The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees<br>Is left this vault to brag of.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085917	Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,<br>Loyal and neutral, in a moment?	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085918	There's daggers in men's smiles.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 3
34085919	A falcon, towering in her pride of place,<br>Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 4
34085920	Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up<br>Thine own life's means!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act II Scene 4
34085921	I must become a borrower of the night<br>For a dark hour or twain.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 1
34085922	Let every man be master of his time<br>Till seven at night.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 1
34085923	Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<br>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,<br>No son of mine succeeding.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 1
34085924	Mur. We are men, my liege.<br>Mac. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 1
34085925	I am one, my liege,<br>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world<br>Have so incensed that I am reckless what<br>I do to spite the world.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 1
34085926	So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,<br>That I would set my life on any chance,<br>To mend it, or be rid on't.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 1
34085927	Things without all remedy<br>Should be without regard; what's done is done.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085928	We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085929	Better be with the dead,<br>Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,<br>Than on the torture of the mind to lie<br>In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;<br>After life's fitful fever he sleeps well:<br>Treason has done his worst; nor stee	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085930	In them Nature's copy's not eterne.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085931	A deed of dreadful note.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085932	Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,<br>Till thou applaud the deed.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085933	Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 2
34085934	Now spurs the lated traveller apace<br>To gain the timely inn.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 3
34085935	But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in<br>To saucy doubts and fears.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085936	Now, good digestion wait on appetite,<br>And health on both!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085937	Thou canst not say I did it; never shake<br>Thy gory locks at me.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085938	The air-drawn dagger.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085939	The time has been,<br>That when the brains were out the man would die,<br>And there an end; but now they rise again,<br>With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,<br>And push us from our stools.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085940	I drink to the general joy o' the whole table.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085941	Thou hast no speculation in those eyes<br>Which thou dost glare with!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085942	A thing of custom,ù't is no other;<br>Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085943	What man dare, I dare:<br>Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,<br>The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger,ù<br>Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves<br>Shall never tremble.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085944	Hence, horrible shadow!<br>Unreal mockery, hence!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085945	You have displac'd the mirth, broke the good meeting,<br>With most admir'd disorder.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085946	Can such things be,<br>And overcome us like a summer's cloud,<br>Without our special wonder?	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085947	Stand not upon the order of your going,<br>But go at once.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085948	Macb. What is the night?<br>L. Macb. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085949	I am in blood<br>Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,<br>Returning were as tedious as go o'er.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 4
34085950	My little spirit, see,<br>Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act III Scene 5
34085951	Double, double toil and trouble;<br>Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085952	Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br>Wool of bat and tongue of dog.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085953	By the pricking of my thumbs,<br>Something wicked this way comes.<br>      Open, locks,<br>      Whoever knocks!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085954	How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085955	A deed without a name.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085956	I'll make assurance double sure,<br>And take a bond of fate.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085957	Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;<br>Come like shadows, so depart!	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085958	What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085959	I'll charm the air to give a sound,<br>While you perform your antic round.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085960	The weird sisters.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085961	The flighty purpose never is o'ertook,<br>Unless the deed go with it.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34085962	When our actions do not,<br>Our fears do make us traitors.	<i>Macbeth</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34085963	For this relief much thanks:'t is bitter cold,<br>And I am sick at heart.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085964	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085965	Whose sore task<br>Does not divide the Sunday from the week.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085966	This sweaty haste<br>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085967	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085968	And then it started like a guilty thing<br>Upon a fearful summons.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085969	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>To his confine.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085970	It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>Some say that ever'gainst that season comes<br>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir...	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085971	So have I heard, and do in part believe it.<br>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 1
34085972	The memory be green.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085973	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085974	The head is not more native to the heart.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085975	A little more than kin, and less than kind.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085976	All that lives must die,<br>Passing through nature to eternity.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085977	Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not "seems."<br>'T is not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>Nor customary suits of solemn black.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085978	But I have that within which passeth show;<br>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085979	'T is a fault to Heaven,<br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>To reason most absurd.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085980	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,<br>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085981	That it should come to this!	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085982	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,<br>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>Visit her face too roughly.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085983	Why, she would hang on him,<br>As if increase of appetite had grown<br>By what it fed on.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085984	Frailty, thy name is woman!	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085985	A little month.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085986	Like Niobe, all tears.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085987	A beast, that wants discourse of reason.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085988	My father's brother, but no more like my father<br>Than I to Hercules.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085989	It is not nor it cannot come to good.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085990	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats<br>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br>Or ever I had seen that day.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085991	In my mind's eye, Horatio.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085992	He was a man, take him for all in all,<br>I shall not look upon his like again.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085993	Season your admiration for a while.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085994	In the dead vast and middle of the night.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085995	Arm'd at point exactly, cap-a-pe.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085996	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085997	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085998	Ham. His beard was grizzled,ùno?<br>Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br>A sable silver'd.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34085999	Let it be tenable in your silence still.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34086000	Give it an understanding, but no tongue.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34086001	Upon the platform,'twixt eleven and twelve.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34086002	Foul deeds will rise,<br>Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 2
34086003	A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>The perfume and suppliance of a minute.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086004	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>And recks not his own rede.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086005	Give thy thoughts no tongue.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086006	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086007	Beware<br>Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,<br>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086008	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>This above all: to thine own self be true,<br>And it must follow, as the night the day...	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086009	Springes to catch woodcocks.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086010	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>Lends the tongue vows.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086011	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 3
34086012	Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.<br>Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086013	But to my mind, though I am native here<br>And to the manner born, it is a custom<br>More honoured in the breach than the observance.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086014	Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086015	I do not set my life at a pin's fee.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 4

34086022	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 5
34086023	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>My custom always of the afternoon.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 5
34086024	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>Unhousell'd, disappointed, unaneled,<br>No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>With all my imperfections on my head.	<i>Hamlet</i>, Act I Scene 5

34086068	Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend!	<i>King Lear</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086069	How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is<br>To have a thankless child!	<i>King Lear</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086070	Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.	<i>King Lear</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086071	Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,<br>Thy element's below.	<i>King Lear</i>, Act II Scene 4

34086126	For I am nothing, if not critical.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086127	I am not merry; but I do beguile<br>The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086128	She that was ever fair and never proud,<br>Had tongue at will, and yet was never loud.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 1

34086131	If after every tempest come such calms,<br>May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086132	Egregiously an ass.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086133	I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086134	Potations pottle-deep.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3

34086136	Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle<br>From her propriety.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086137	Your name is great<br>In mouths of wisest censure.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086138	Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086139	Cassio, I love thee;<br>But never more be officer of mine.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086140	Iago. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?<br>Cas. Ay, past all surgery.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086141	Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086142	O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086143	O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086144	Cas. Every inordinate cup is unbless'd, and the ingredient is a devil.<br>Iago. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086145	How poor are they that have not patience!	<i>Othello</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086146	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,<br>But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,<br>Chaos is come again.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086147	Speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts<br>The worst of words.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086148	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!<br>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<br>The meat it feeds on.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086149	But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er<br>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086150	Poor and content is rich and rich enough.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086151	To be once in doubt<br>Is once to be resolv'd.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086152	If I do prove her haggard,<br>Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,<br>I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,<br>To prey at fortune.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086153	I am declined<br>Into the vale of years.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086154	O curse of marriage,<br>That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<br>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<br>And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<br>Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br>For others' uses.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086155	Trifles light as air<br>Are to the jealous confirmations strong<br>As proofs of holy writ.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086156	Not poppy, nor mandragora,<br>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<br>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br>Which thou owedst yesterday.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086157	I swear't is better to be much abused<br>Than but to know't a little.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086158	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolen,<br>Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086159	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086160	No hinge nor loop<br>To hang a doubt on.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086161	On horror's head horrors accumulate.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086162	Take note, take note, O world,<br>To be direct and honest is not safe.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086163	But this denoted a foregone conclusion.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086164	Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br>For't is of aspics' tongues!	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086165	Our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	<i>Othello</i>, Act III Scene 4
34086166	To beguile many, and be beguil'd by one.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34086167	They laugh that win.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34086168	But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 1
34086169	I understand a fury in your words,<br>But not the words.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086170	Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086171	But, alas, to make me<br>A fixed figure for the time of scorn<br>To point his slow unmoving finger	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086172	Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086173	O thou weed,<br>Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet<br>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086174	O Heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,<br>And put in every honest hand a whip<br>To lash the rascals naked through the world!	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086175	'T is neither here nor there.	<i>Othello</i>, Act IV Scene 3
34086176	It makes us or it mars us.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 1
34086177	Every way makes my gain.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 1
34086178	He hath a daily beauty in his life.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 1
34086179	This is the night<br>That either makes me or fordoes me quite.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 1
34086180	And smooth as monumental alabaster.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086181	So sweet was ne'er so fatal.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086182	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge<br>Had stomach for them all.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086183	One entire and perfect chrysolite.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086184	Curse his better angel from his side,<br>And fall to reprobation.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086185	Every puny whipster.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086186	Man but a rush against Othello's breast,<br>And he retires.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086187	I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br>And smote him, thus.	<i>Othello</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086188	There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 1
34086189	On the sudden<br>A Roman thought hath struck him.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 2
34086190	This grief is crowned with consolation.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 2
34086191	Give me to drink mandragora.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 5
34086192	Where's my serpent of old Nile?	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 5
34086193	A morsel for a monarch.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 5
34086194	My salad days,<br>When I was green in judgment.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I Scene 5
34086195	Epicurean cooks<br>Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086196	Small to greater matters must give way.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act II Scene 2

34086200	Come, thou monarch of the vine,<br>Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act II Scene 7
34086201	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can<br>Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,<br>The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,<br>Than gain which darkens him.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act III Scene 1

34086203	Men's judgments are<br>A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward<br>Do draw the inward quality after them,<br>To suffer all alike.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act III Scene 13
34086204	To business that we love we rise betime,<br>And go to't with delight.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 4
34086205	This morning, like the spirit of a youth<br>That means to be of note, begins betimes.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 4
34086206	The shirt of Nessus is upon me.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 12
34086207	Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;<br>A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,<br>A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,<br>A forked mountain, or blue promontory<br>With trees upon't.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 14
34086208	That which is now a horse, even with a thought<br>The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,<br>As water is in water.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 14
34086209	Since Cleopatra died,<br>I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods<br>Detest my baseness.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 14
34086210	I am dying, Egypt, dying.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 15
34086211	O, wither'd is the garland of the war,<br>The soldier's pole is fallen.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 15
34086212	Let's do it after the high Roman fashion.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act IV Scene 15
34086213	For his bounty,<br>There was no winter in't; an autumn't was<br>That grew the more by reaping.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086214	If there be, or ever were, one such,<br>It's past the size of dreaming.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086215	Mechanic slaves<br>With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086216	I have<br>Immortal longings in me.	<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act V Scene 2
34086217	Lest the bargain should catch cold and starve.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act I Scene 4
34086218	Hath his bellyful of fighting.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086219	How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act II Scene 2
34086220	The most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086221	Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,<br>  And Ph£bus'gins arise,	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act II Scene 3
34086222	As chaste as unsunn'd snow.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act II Scene 5
34086223	Some griefs are medicinable.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 2
34086224	Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086225	So slippery that<br>The fear's as bad as falling.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086226	The game is up.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 3
34086227	No,'t is slander,<br>Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue<br>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath<br>Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie<br>All corners of the world.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 4
34086228	Some jay of Italy,<br>Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:<br>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 4
34086229	It is no act of common passage, but<br>A strain of rareness.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 4
34086230	I have not slept one wink.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 4
34086231	Thou art all the comfort<br>The gods will diet me with.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 4
34086232	Weariness<br>Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth<br>Finds the down pillow hard.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 6
34086233	An angel! or, if not,<br>An earthly paragon!	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act III Scene 6
34086234	Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys<br>Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086235	And put<br>My clouted brogues from off my feet.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086236	Golden lads and girls all must,<br>As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act IV Scene 2
34086237	O, never say hereafter<br>But I am truest speaker. You call'd me brother<br>When I was but your sister.	<i>Cymbeline</i>, Act V Scene 5
34086238	Like an arrow shot<br>From a well-experienc'd archer hits the mark<br>His eye doth level at.	<i>Pericles</i>, Act I Scene 1
34086239	3 Fish. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.<br>1 Fish. Why, as men do a-land: the great ones eat up the little ones.	<i>Pericles</i>, Act II Scene 1
34086240	Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear.	<i>Venus and Adonis</i>
34086241	For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,<br>And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.	<i>Venus and Adonis</i>

34086244	Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee<br>Calls back the lovely April of her prime.	<i>Sonnet III</i>
34086245	And stretched metre of an antique song.	<i>Sonnet XVII</i>
34086246	But thy eternal summer shall not fade.	<i>Sonnet XVIII</i>
34086247	The painful warrior famoused for fight,	<i>Sonnet XXV</i>
34086248	When to the sessions of sweet silent thought<br>I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste.	<i>Sonnet XXX</i>
34086249	Full many a glorious morning have I seen.	<i>Sonnet XXXIII</i>
34086250	My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	<i>Sonnet I</i>
34086251	Like stones of worth, they thinly placed are,<br>Or captain jewels in the carcanet.	<i>Sonnet III</i>
34086252	The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br>For that sweet odour which doth in it live.	<i>Sonnet XIII</i>
34086253	Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br>Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme.	<i>Sonnet IV</i>
34086254	Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<br>But sad mortality o'ersways their power,<br>How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<br>Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	<i>Sonnet XIV</i>
34086255	And art made tongue-tied by authority.	<i>Sonnet lxvi</i>
34086256	And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,<br>And captive good attending captain ill.	<i>Sonnet LXVI</i>
34086257	The ornament of beauty is suspect,<br>A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	<i>Sonnet XX</i>
34086258	That time of year thou may'st in me behold,<br>When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,ù<br>Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	<i>Sonnet XXIII</i>
34086259	Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing.	<i>Sonnet XXXVII</i>
34086260	Do not drop in for an after-loss.<br>Ah, do not, when my heart hath'scap'd this sorrow,<br>Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;<br>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,<br>To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.	<i>Sonnet XC</i>
34086261	When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,<br>Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.	<i>Sonnet XCVIII</i>
34086262	Still constant is a wondrous excellence.	<i>Sonnet CV</i>
34086263	And beauty, making beautiful old rhyme.	<i>Sonnet CVI</i>
34086264	My nature is subdu'd<br>To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.	<i>Sonnet CXI</i>
34086265	Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>Admit impediments: love is not love<br>Which alters when it alteration finds.	<i>Sonnet CXVI</i>
34086266	'T is better to be vile than vile esteem'd,<br>When not to be receives reproach of being;<br>And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd,<br>Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.	<i>Sonnet CXXI</i>
34086267	No, I am that I am, and they that level<br>At my abuses reckon up their own.	<i>Sonnet CXXI</i>
34086268	That full star that ushers in the even.	<i>Sonnet CXXXII</i>
34086269	O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies<br>In the small orb of one particular tear.	<i>A Lover's Complaint</i>
34086270	Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.	<i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>
34086271	Crabbed age and youth<br>Cannot live together.	<i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>
34086272	Have you not heard it said full oft,<br>A woman's nay doth stand for naught?	<i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>
34086273	Cursed be he that moves my bones.	<i>Shakespeare's Epitaph</i>
