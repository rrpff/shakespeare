<span class="line">I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</span>

<span class="line">As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</span>

<span class="line">'It is as hard to come as for a camel</span>

<span class="line">Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</span>

<span class="line">Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</span>
<span class="line">Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</span>
<span class="line">Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</span>
<span class="line">While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</span>
