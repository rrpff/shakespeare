              <span class="line">As it fell upon a day</span>
<span class="line">In the merry month of May,</span>
<span class="line">Sitting in a pleasant shade</span>
<span class="line">Which a grove of myrtles made,</span>
<span class="line">Beasts did leap, and birds did sing,</span>
<span class="line">Trees did grow, and plants did spring;</span>
<span class="line">Every thing did banish moan,</span>
<span class="line">Save the nightingale alone:</span>
<span class="line">She, poor bird, as all forlorn,</span>
<span class="line">Lean'd her breast up-till a thorn</span>
<span class="line">And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,</span>
<span class="line">That to hear it was great pity:</span>
<span class="line">'Fie, fie, fie,' now would she cry;</span>
<span class="line">'Tereu, tereu!' by and by;</span>
<span class="line">That to hear her so complain,</span>
<span class="line">Scarce I could from tears refrain;</span>
<span class="line">For her griefs, so lively shown,</span>
<span class="line">Made me think upon mine own.</span>
<span class="line">Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain!</span>
<span class="line">None takes pity on thy pain:</span>
<span class="line">Senseless trees they cannot hear thee;</span>
<span class="line">Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:</span>
<span class="line">King Pandion he is dead;</span>
<span class="line">All thy friends are lapp'd in lead;</span>
<span class="line">All thy fellow birds do sing,</span>
<span class="line">Careless of thy sorrowing.</span>
<span class="line">Even so, poor bird, like thee,</span>
<span class="line">None alive will pity me.</span>
<span class="line">Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled,</span>
<span class="line">Thou and I were both beguiled.</span>
<span class="line">Every one that flatters thee</span>
<span class="line">Is no friend in misery.</span>
<span class="line">Words are easy, like the wind;</span>
<span class="line">Faithful friends are hard to find:</span>
<span class="line">Every man will be thy friend</span>
<span class="line">Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;</span>
<span class="line">But if store of crowns be scant,</span>
<span class="line">No man will supply thy want.</span>
<span class="line">If that one be prodigal,</span>
<span class="line">Bountiful they will him call,</span>
<span class="line">And with such-like flattering,</span>
<span class="line">'Pity but he were a king;'</span>
<span class="line">If he be addict to vice,</span>
<span class="line">Quickly him they will entice;</span>
<span class="line">If to women he be bent,</span>
<span class="line">They have at commandement:</span>
<span class="line">But if Fortune once do frown,</span>
<span class="line">Then farewell his great renown</span>
<span class="line">They that fawn'd on him before</span>
<span class="line">Use his company no more.</span>
<span class="line">He that is thy friend indeed,</span>
<span class="line">He will help thee in thy need:</span>
<span class="line">If thou sorrow, he will weep;</span>
<span class="line">If thou wake, he cannot sleep;</span>
<span class="line">Thus of every grief in heart</span>
<span class="line">He with thee doth bear a part.</span>
<span class="line">These are certain signs to know</span>
<span class="line">Faithful friend from flattering foe.</span>
