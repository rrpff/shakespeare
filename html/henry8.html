              <span class="line">I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</span>
<span class="line">That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</span>
<span class="line">Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</span>
<span class="line">Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</span>
<span class="line">We now present. Those that can pity, here</span>
<span class="line">May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</span>
<span class="line">The subject will deserve it. Such as give</span>
<span class="line">Their money out of hope they may believe,</span>
<span class="line">May here find truth too. Those that come to see</span>
<span class="line">Only a show or two, and so agree</span>
<span class="line">The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</span>
<span class="line">I'll undertake may see away their shilling</span>
<span class="line">Richly in two short hours. Only they</span>
<span class="line">That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</span>
<span class="line">A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</span>
<span class="line">In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</span>
<span class="line">Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</span>
<span class="line">To rank our chosen truth with such a show</span>
<span class="line">As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</span>
<span class="line">Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</span>
<span class="line">To make that only true we now intend,</span>
<span class="line">Will leave us never an understanding friend.</span>
<span class="line">Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</span>
<span class="line">The first and happiest hearers of the town,</span>
<span class="line">Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</span>
<span class="line">The very persons of our noble story</span>
<span class="line">As they were living; think you see them great,</span>
<span class="line">And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</span>
<span class="line">Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</span>
<span class="line">How soon this mightiness meets misery:</span>
<span class="line">And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</span>
<span class="line">A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</span>

<span class="line">I free you from't. You are not to be taught</span>
<span class="line">That you have many enemies, that know not</span>

<span class="line">Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</span>
<span class="line">The queen is put in anger. You're excused:</span>
<span class="line">But will you be more justified? You ever</span>
<span class="line">Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired</span>
<span class="line">It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,</span>
<span class="line">The passages made toward it: on my honour,</span>
<span class="line">I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</span>
<span class="line">And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,</span>
<span class="line">I will be bold with time and your attention:</span>
<span class="line">Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:</span>
<span class="line">My conscience first received a tenderness,</span>
<span class="line">Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</span>
<span class="line">By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</span>
<span class="line">Who had been hither sent on the debating</span>
<span class="line">A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</span>
<span class="line">Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</span>
<span class="line">Ere a determinate resolution, he,</span>
<span class="line">I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</span>
<span class="line">Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</span>
<span class="line">Whether our daughter were legitimate,</span>
<span class="line">Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</span>
<span class="line">Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</span>
<span class="line">The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</span>
<span class="line">Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</span>
<span class="line">The region of my breast; which forced such way,</span>
<span class="line">That many mazed considerings did throng</span>
<span class="line">And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</span>
<span class="line">I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</span>
<span class="line">Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</span>
<span class="line">If it conceived a male child by me, should</span>
<span class="line">Do no more offices of life to't than</span>
<span class="line">The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</span>
<span class="line">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</span>
<span class="line">This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</span>
<span class="line">This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</span>
<span class="line">Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</span>
<span class="line">Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</span>
<span class="line">I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</span>
<span class="line">By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</span>
<span class="line">Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</span>
<span class="line">The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</span>
<span class="line">Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</span>
<span class="line">Now present here together: that's to say,</span>
<span class="line">I meant to rectify my conscience,--which</span>
<span class="line">I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--</span>
<span class="line">By all the reverend fathers of the land</span>
<span class="line">And doctors learn'd: first I began in private</span>
<span class="line">With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember</span>
<span class="line">How under my oppression I did reek,</span>

<span class="line">This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--</span>
<span class="line">Though in her cradle, yet now promises</span>
<span class="line">Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</span>
<span class="line">Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--</span>

<span class="line">Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</span>

<span class="line">Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</span>

<span class="line">In her days every man shall eat in safety,</span>
<span class="line">Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</span>
<span class="line">The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</span>
<span class="line">God shall be truly known; and those about her</span>
<span class="line">From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</span>
<span class="line">And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</span>
<span class="line">Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</span>
<span class="line">The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</span>
<span class="line">Her ashes new create another heir,</span>
<span class="line">As great in admiration as herself;</span>
<span class="line">So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</span>
<span class="line">When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</span>
<span class="line">Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</span>
<span class="line">Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</span>
<span class="line">And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</span>
<span class="line">That were the servants to this chosen infant,</span>
<span class="line">Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</span>
<span class="line">Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</span>
<span class="line">His honour and the greatness of his name</span>
<span class="line">Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</span>
<span class="line">And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</span>
<span class="line">To all the plains about him: our children's children</span>
<span class="line">Shall see this, and bless heaven.</span>
