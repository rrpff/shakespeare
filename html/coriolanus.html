<span class="line">Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</span>

<span class="line">I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,</span>

<span class="line">Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</span>

<span class="line">The senators and patricians love him too:</span>
<span class="line">The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</span>
<span class="line">Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</span>
<span class="line">To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome</span>
<span class="line">As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</span>
<span class="line">By sovereignty of nature. First he was</span>
<span class="line">A noble servant to them; but he could not</span>
<span class="line">Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,</span>
<span class="line">Which out of daily fortune ever taints</span>
<span class="line">The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</span>
<span class="line">To fail in the disposing of those chances</span>
<span class="line">Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</span>
<span class="line">Not to be other than one thing, not moving</span>
<span class="line">From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</span>
<span class="line">Even with the same austerity and garb</span>
<span class="line">As he controll'd the war; but one of these--</span>
<span class="line">As he hath spices of them all, not all,</span>
<span class="line">For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,</span>
<span class="line">So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,</span>
<span class="line">To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues</span>
<span class="line">Lie in the interpretation of the time:</span>
<span class="line">And power, unto itself most commendable,</span>
<span class="line">Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</span>
<span class="line">To extol what it hath done.</span>
<span class="line">One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</span>
<span class="line">Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</span>
<span class="line">Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</span>
<span class="line">Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</span>

              <span class="line">Nay, go not from us thus.</span>
<span class="line">If it were so that our request did tend</span>
<span class="line">To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</span>
<span class="line">The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,</span>
<span class="line">As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit</span>
<span class="line">Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</span>
<span class="line">May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,</span>
<span class="line">'This we received;' and each in either side</span>
<span class="line">Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest</span>
<span class="line">For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,</span>
<span class="line">The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,</span>
<span class="line">That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</span>
<span class="line">Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,</span>
<span class="line">Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;</span>
<span class="line">Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,</span>
<span class="line">But with his last attempt he wiped it out;</span>
<span class="line">Destroy'd his country, and his name remains</span>
<span class="line">To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:</span>
<span class="line">Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</span>
<span class="line">To imitate the graces of the gods;</span>
<span class="line">To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,</span>
<span class="line">And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt</span>
<span class="line">That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</span>
<span class="line">Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man</span>
<span class="line">Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:</span>
<span class="line">He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:</span>
<span class="line">Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</span>
<span class="line">Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world</span>
<span class="line">More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate</span>
<span class="line">Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</span>
<span class="line">Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,</span>
<span class="line">When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</span>
<span class="line">Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,</span>
<span class="line">Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,</span>
<span class="line">And spurn me back: but if it be not so,</span>
<span class="line">Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,</span>
<span class="line">That thou restrain'st from me the duty which</span>
<span class="line">To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:</span>
<span class="line">Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.</span>
<span class="line">To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride</span>
<span class="line">Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;</span>
<span class="line">This is the last: so we will home to Rome,</span>
<span class="line">And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:</span>
<span class="line">This boy, that cannot tell what he would have</span>
<span class="line">But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,</span>
<span class="line">Does reason our petition with more strength</span>
<span class="line">Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:</span>
<span class="line">This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;</span>
<span class="line">His wife is in Corioli and his child</span>
<span class="line">Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:</span>
<span class="line">I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,</span>
