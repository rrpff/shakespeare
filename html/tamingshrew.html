              <span class="line">Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</span>
<span class="line">And dart not scornful glances from those eyes</span>
<span class="line">To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</span>
<span class="line">It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</span>
<span class="line">Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</span>
<span class="line">And in no sense is meet or amiable.</span>
<span class="line">A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-</span>
<span class="line">Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</span>
<span class="line">And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</span>
<span class="line">Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</span>
<span class="line">Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</span>
<span class="line">Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</span>
<span class="line">And for thy maintenance commits his body</span>
<span class="line">To painful labour both by sea and land,</span>
<span class="line">To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</span>
<span class="line">Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</span>
<span class="line">And craves no other tribute at thy hands</span>
<span class="line">But love, fair looks, and true obedience-</span>
<span class="line">Too little payment for so great a debt.</span>
<span class="line">Such duty as the subject owes the prince,</span>
<span class="line">Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</span>
<span class="line">And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</span>
<span class="line">And not obedient to his honest will,</span>
<span class="line">What is she but a foul contending rebel</span>
<span class="line">And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</span>
<span class="line">I am asham'd that women are so simple</span>
<span class="line">To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</span>
<span class="line">Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,</span>
<span class="line">When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.</span>
<span class="line">Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</span>
<span class="line">Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</span>
<span class="line">But that our soft conditions and our hearts</span>
<span class="line">Should well agree with our external parts?</span>
<span class="line">Come, come, you forward and unable worms!</span>
<span class="line">My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</span>
<span class="line">My heart as great, my reason haply more,</span>
<span class="line">To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</span>
<span class="line">But now I see our lances are but straws,</span>
<span class="line">Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</span>
<span class="line">That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</span>
<span class="line">Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</span>
<span class="line">And place your hands below your husband's foot;</span>
<span class="line">In token of which duty, if he please,</span>
<span class="line">My hand is ready, may it do him ease.</span>
