<span class="line">Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</span>
<span class="line">And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels</span>
<span class="line">From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:</span>
<span class="line">Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</span>
<span class="line">The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,</span>
<span class="line">I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</span>

<span class="line">Many for many virtues excellent,</span>
<span class="line">None but for some and yet all different.</span>
<span class="line">O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</span>
<span class="line">In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</span>
<span class="line">For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</span>
<span class="line">But to the earth some special good doth give,</span>
<span class="line">Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</span>
<span class="line">Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</span>
<span class="line">Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</span>
<span class="line">And vice sometimes by action dignified.</span>
<span class="line">Within the infant rind of this small flower</span>
<span class="line">Poison hath residence and medicine power:</span>
<span class="line">For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</span>
<span class="line">Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</span>
<span class="line">Two such opposed kings encamp them still</span>

<span class="line">Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</span>
<span class="line">Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</span>
<span class="line">And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</span>
<span class="line">I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</span>
<span class="line">Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</span>
<span class="line">Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</span>
<span class="line">For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</span>
<span class="line">You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</span>
<span class="line">Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</span>
<span class="line">To County Paris: then comes she to me,</span>
<span class="line">And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</span>
<span class="line">To rid her from this second marriage,</span>
<span class="line">Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</span>
<span class="line">Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</span>
<span class="line">A sleeping potion; which so took effect</span>
<span class="line">As I intended, for it wrought on her</span>
<span class="line">The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</span>
<span class="line">That he should hither come as this dire night,</span>
<span class="line">To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</span>
<span class="line">Being the time the potion's force should cease.</span>
<span class="line">But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</span>
<span class="line">Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</span>
<span class="line">Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</span>
<span class="line">At the prefixed hour of her waking,</span>
<span class="line">Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</span>
<span class="line">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</span>
<span class="line">Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</span>
<span class="line">But when I came, some minute ere the time</span>
<span class="line">Of her awaking, here untimely lay</span>
<span class="line">The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</span>
<span class="line">She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</span>
<span class="line">And bear this work of heaven with patience:</span>
<span class="line">But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</span>
<span class="line">And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</span>
<span class="line">But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</span>
<span class="line">All this I know; and to the marriage</span>
<span class="line">Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</span>
<span class="line">Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</span>

<span class="line">Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</span>
<span class="line">And here he writes that he did buy a poison</span>
<span class="line">Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</span>
<span class="line">Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</span>
<span class="line">Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</span>

<span class="line">That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</span>
<span class="line">And I for winking at your discords too</span>
<span class="line">Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.</span>
