<span class="line">Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.</span>
<span class="line">Consider what you first did swear unto,</span>
<span class="line">To fast, to study, and to see no woman;</span>
<span class="line">Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.</span>
<span class="line">Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;</span>
<span class="line">And abstinence engenders maladies.</span>
<span class="line">And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,</span>
<span class="line">In that each of you have forsworn his book,</span>
<span class="line">Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</span>
<span class="line">For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</span>
<span class="line">Have found the ground of study's excellence</span>
<span class="line">Without the beauty of a woman's face?</span>
<span class="line">[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;]</span>
<span class="line">They are the ground, the books, the academes</span>
<span class="line">From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire]</span>
<span class="line">Why, universal plodding poisons up</span>
<span class="line">The nimble spirits in the arteries,</span>
<span class="line">As motion and long-during action tires</span>
<span class="line">The sinewy vigour of the traveller.</span>
<span class="line">Now, for not looking on a woman's face,</span>
<span class="line">You have in that forsworn the use of eyes</span>
<span class="line">And study too, the causer of your vow;</span>
<span class="line">For where is any author in the world</span>
<span class="line">Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?</span>
<span class="line">Learning is but an adjunct to ourself</span>
<span class="line">And where we are our learning likewise is:</span>
<span class="line">Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,</span>
<span class="line">Do we not likewise see our learning there?</span>
<span class="line">O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</span>
<span class="line">And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</span>
<span class="line">For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</span>
<span class="line">In leaden contemplation have found out</span>
<span class="line">Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</span>
<span class="line">Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?</span>
<span class="line">Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</span>
<span class="line">And therefore, finding barren practisers,</span>
<span class="line">Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</span>
<span class="line">But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,</span>
<span class="line">Lives not alone immured in the brain;</span>
<span class="line">But, with the motion of all elements,</span>
<span class="line">Courses as swift as thought in every power,</span>
<span class="line">And gives to every power a double power,</span>
<span class="line">Above their functions and their offices.</span>
<span class="line">It adds a precious seeing to the eye;</span>
<span class="line">A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</span>
<span class="line">A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,</span>
<span class="line">When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:</span>
<span class="line">Love's feeling is more soft and sensible</span>
<span class="line">Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;</span>
<span class="line">Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:</span>
<span class="line">For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</span>
<span class="line">Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</span>
<span class="line">Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</span>
<span class="line">As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:</span>
<span class="line">And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</span>
<span class="line">Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</span>
<span class="line">Never durst poet touch a pen to write</span>
<span class="line">Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;</span>
<span class="line">O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</span>
<span class="line">And plant in tyrants mild humility.</span>
<span class="line">From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:</span>
<span class="line">They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</span>
<span class="line">They are the books, the arts, the academes,</span>
<span class="line">That show, contain and nourish all the world:</span>
<span class="line">Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</span>
<span class="line">Then fools you were these women to forswear,</span>
<span class="line">Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</span>
<span class="line">For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,</span>
<span class="line">Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,</span>
<span class="line">Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,</span>
<span class="line">Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,</span>
<span class="line">Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</span>
<span class="line">Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</span>
<span class="line">It is religion to be thus forsworn,</span>
<span class="line">For charity itself fulfills the law,</span>
<span class="line">And who can sever love from charity?</span>
