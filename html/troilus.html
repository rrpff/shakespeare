              <span class="line">In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</span>
<span class="line">The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,</span>
<span class="line">Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,</span>
<span class="line">Fraught with the ministers and instruments</span>
<span class="line">Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore</span>
<span class="line">Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay</span>
<span class="line">Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</span>
<span class="line">To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</span>
<span class="line">The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,</span>
<span class="line">With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.</span>
<span class="line">To Tenedos they come;</span>
<span class="line">And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</span>
<span class="line">Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains</span>
<span class="line">The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</span>
<span class="line">Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,</span>
<span class="line">Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</span>
<span class="line">And Antenorides, with massy staples</span>
<span class="line">And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</span>
<span class="line">Sperr up the sons of Troy.</span>
<span class="line">Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</span>
<span class="line">On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</span>
<span class="line">Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come</span>
<span class="line">A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence</span>
<span class="line">Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited</span>
<span class="line">In like conditions as our argument,</span>
<span class="line">To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</span>
<span class="line">Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</span>
<span class="line">Beginning in the middle, starting thence away</span>
<span class="line">To what may be digested in a play.</span>
<span class="line">Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:</span>
<span class="line">Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.</span>

<span class="line">There is a law in each well-order'd nation</span>

              <span class="line">The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,</span>
<span class="line">Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,</span>
<span class="line">Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;</span>
<span class="line">Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:</span>
<span class="line">His heart and hand both open and both free;</span>
<span class="line">For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;</span>
<span class="line">Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,</span>
<span class="line">Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;</span>
<span class="line">Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;</span>
<span class="line">For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes</span>
<span class="line">To tender objects, but he in heat of action</span>
<span class="line">Is more vindicative than jealous love:</span>
<span class="line">They call him Troilus, and on him erect</span>
