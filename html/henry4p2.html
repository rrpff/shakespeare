<span class="line">The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</span>
<span class="line">I, from the orient to the drooping west,</span>
<span class="line">Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</span>
<span class="line">The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</span>
<span class="line">Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</span>
<span class="line">The which in every language I pronounce,</span>
<span class="line">Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</span>
<span class="line">I speak of peace while covert emnity,</span>
<span class="line">Under the smile of safety, wounds the world;</span>
<span class="line">And who but Rumour, who but only I,</span>
<span class="line">Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,</span>
<span class="line">Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</span>
<span class="line">Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</span>
<span class="line">And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</span>
<span class="line">Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</span>
<span class="line">And of so easy and so plain a stop</span>
<span class="line">That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</span>
<span class="line">The still-discordant wav'ring multitude,</span>
<span class="line">Can play upon it. But what need I thus</span>
<span class="line">My well-known body to anatomize</span>
<span class="line">Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</span>
<span class="line">I run before King Harry's victory,</span>
<span class="line">Who, in a bloody field by Shrewsbury,</span>
<span class="line">Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</span>
<span class="line">Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</span>
<span class="line">Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I</span>
<span class="line">To speak so true at first? My office is</span>
<span class="line">To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</span>
<span class="line">Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,</span>
<span class="line">And that the King before the Douglas' rage</span>
<span class="line">Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.</span>
<span class="line">This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns</span>
<span class="line">Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</span>
<span class="line">And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</span>
<span class="line">Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,</span>
<span class="line">Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</span>
<span class="line">And not a man of them brings other news</span>
<span class="line">Than they have learnt of me. From Rumour's tongues</span>
<span class="line">They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.</span>

<span class="line">done about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer paid</span>

<span class="line">was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the</span>
<span class="line">whores call'd him mandrake. 'A came ever in the rearward of the</span>
<span class="line">fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that</span>
<span class="line">he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or</span>
<span class="line">his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire,</span>
<span class="line">and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn</span>
<span class="line">brother to him; and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in</span>
<span class="line">the Tiltyard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the</span>
<span class="line">marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own</span>
<span class="line">name; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an</span>
<span class="line">eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</span>
<span class="line">court--and now has he land and beeves. Well, I'll be acquainted</span>
<span class="line">with him if I return; and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a</span>
<span class="line">philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for</span>
<span class="line">the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap</span>
<span class="line">at him. Let time shape, and there an end.   Exit</span>

              <span class="line">Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</span>
<span class="line">Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd</span>
<span class="line">And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</span>

<span class="line">To diet rank minds sick of happiness,</span>
<span class="line">And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop</span>
<span class="line">Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</span>
<span class="line">I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</span>
<span class="line">What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</span>
<span class="line">And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</span>
<span class="line">We see which way the stream of time doth run</span>
<span class="line">And are enforc'd from our most quiet there</span>
<span class="line">By the rough torrent of occasion;</span>
<span class="line">And have the summary of all our griefs,</span>
<span class="line">When time shall serve, to show in articles;</span>
<span class="line">Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,</span>
<span class="line">And might by no suit gain our audience:</span>
<span class="line">When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,</span>
<span class="line">We are denied access unto his person,</span>
<span class="line">Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</span>
<span class="line">The dangers of the days but newly gone,</span>
<span class="line">Whose memory is written on the earth</span>
<span class="line">With yet appearing blood, and the examples</span>
<span class="line">Of every minute's instance, present now,</span>
<span class="line">Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms;</span>
<span class="line">Not to break peace, or any branch of it,</span>

<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the</span>
<span class="line">end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to</span>
<span class="line">promise you a better. I meant, indeed, to pay you with this; which if like an</span>
<span class="line">ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle</span>
<span class="line">creditors, lose. Here I promis'd you I would be, and here I</span>
<span class="line">commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some,</span>
<span class="line">and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely; and so I kneel down</span>

<span class="line">If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command</span>

<span class="line">your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible</span>
<span class="line">satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</span>
<span class="line">forgiven me. If the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree</span>
<span class="line">with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before in such an assembly.</span>

<span class="line">One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy'd</span>
<span class="line">with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in</span>
<span class="line">it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France; where, for</span>
<span class="line">anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already 'a</span>
<span class="line">be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr and</span>
<span class="line">this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will</span>
