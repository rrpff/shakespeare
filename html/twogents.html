<span class="line">puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</span>
<span class="line">four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.</span>
<span class="line">I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,</span>
<span class="line">'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver</span>
<span class="line">him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;</span>
<span class="line">and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he</span>
<span class="line">steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:</span>
<span class="line">O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself</span>
<span class="line">in all companies! I would have, as one should say,</span>
<span class="line">one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,</span>
<span class="line">as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had</span>
<span class="line">more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,</span>
<span class="line">I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I</span>
<span class="line">live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He</span>
<span class="line">thrusts me himself into the company of three or four</span>
<span class="line">gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had</span>
<span class="line">not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but</span>
<span class="line">all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says</span>
<span class="line">one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him</span>
<span class="line">out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.</span>
<span class="line">I, having been acquainted with the smell before,</span>
<span class="line">knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that</span>
<span class="line">whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip</span>
<span class="line">the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him</span>
<span class="line">the more wrong,' quoth I; 'twas I did the thing you</span>
<span class="line">wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out</span>
<span class="line">of the chamber. How many masters would do this for</span>
<span class="line">his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</span>
<span class="line">stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had</span>
<span class="line">been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese</span>
<span class="line">he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.</span>
<span class="line">Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the</span>
<span class="line">trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam</span>
<span class="line">Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I</span>
