<span class="line">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</span>
<span class="line">Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</span>

<span class="line">Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</span>

<span class="line">Was not devised for the realm of France:</span>
<span class="line">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</span>
<span class="line">Until four hundred one and twenty years</span>

<span class="line">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</span>
<span class="line">Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</span>
<span class="line">Beyond the river Sala, in the year</span>
<span class="line">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</span>

<span class="line">Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</span>
<span class="line">Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</span>
<span class="line">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</span>
<span class="line">To find his title with some shows of truth,</span>
<span class="line">'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</span>
<span class="line">Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</span>
<span class="line">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</span>
<span class="line">To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</span>
<span class="line">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</span>

<span class="line">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</span>
<span class="line">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</span>
<span class="line">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</span>
<span class="line">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</span>
<span class="line">Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</span>
<span class="line">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</span>
<span class="line">Was re-united to the crown of France.</span>

<span class="line">King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</span>
<span class="line">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</span>
<span class="line">To hold in right and title of the female:</span>
<span class="line">So do the kings of France unto this day;</span>
<span class="line">Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</span>
<span class="line">To bar your highness claiming from the female,</span>
<span class="line">And rather choose to hide them in a net</span>
<span class="line">Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</span>

<span class="line">three, though they would serve me, could not be man</span>
<span class="line">to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</span>
<span class="line">a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</span>
<span class="line">red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</span>
<span class="line">fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</span>
<span class="line">and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</span>
<span class="line">words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</span>
<span class="line">heard that men of few words are the best men; and</span>
<span class="line">therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</span>
<span class="line">should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</span>
<span class="line">are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</span>
<span class="line">broke any man's head but his own, and that was</span>
<span class="line">against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</span>
<span class="line">any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</span>
<span class="line">lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</span>
<span class="line">three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</span>
<span class="line">brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</span>
<span class="line">fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</span>
<span class="line">men would carry coals. They would have me as</span>
<span class="line">familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</span>
<span class="line">handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</span>

<span class="line">many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</span>

<span class="line">bound to answer the particular endings of his</span>
<span class="line">soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</span>
<span class="line">his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</span>
<span class="line">they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</span>
<span class="line">king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</span>
<span class="line">the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</span>
<span class="line">unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</span>
<span class="line">the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</span>
<span class="line">some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</span>
<span class="line">perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</span>

<span class="line">impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</span>
<span class="line">subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</span>
<span class="line">soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</span>
<span class="line">the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</span>

<span class="line">armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</span>
<span class="line">be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</span>

<span class="line">eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;</span>

<span class="line">nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</span>

<span class="line">right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</span>
<span class="line">places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</span>
<span class="line">can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</span>
<span class="line">always reason themselves out again. What! a</span>
<span class="line">speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</span>
<span class="line">good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a</span>
<span class="line">black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow</span>
<span class="line">bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax</span>
<span class="line">hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</span>
<span class="line">moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it</span>
<span class="line">shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</span>
<span class="line">course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</span>
<span class="line">me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,</span>
<span class="line">take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</span>
