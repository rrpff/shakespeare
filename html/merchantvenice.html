<span class="line">'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'</span>

<span class="line">run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the</span>
<span class="line">fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil</span>
<span class="line">himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil</span>
<span class="line">incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is</span>
<span class="line">but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel</span>
