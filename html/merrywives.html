<span class="line">Her father hath commanded her to slip</span>
<span class="line">Away with Slender and with him at Eton</span>

<span class="line">That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</span>
<span class="line">While other sports are tasking of their minds,</span>
<span class="line">And at the deanery, where a priest attends,</span>
<span class="line">Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot</span>
<span class="line">She seemingly obedient likewise hath</span>
<span class="line">Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</span>
<span class="line">Her father means she shall be all in white,</span>
<span class="line">And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</span>
<span class="line">To take her by the hand and bid her go,</span>
<span class="line">She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,</span>
<span class="line">The better to denote her to the doctor,</span>
<span class="line">For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,</span>
<span class="line">That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,</span>
<span class="line">With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;</span>
<span class="line">And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</span>
<span class="line">To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,</span>
<span class="line">The maid hath given consent to go with him.</span>
