              <span class="line">[To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why should</span>
<span class="line">this change of thoughts,</span>
<span class="line">The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</span>
<span class="line">Be my so used a guest as not an hour,</span>
<span class="line">In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,</span>
<span class="line">The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</span>
<span class="line">Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</span>
<span class="line">And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,</span>
<span class="line">Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:</span>
<span class="line">Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,</span>
<span class="line">Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.</span>
<span class="line">Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</span>
<span class="line">That have their first conception by mis-dread,</span>
<span class="line">Have after-nourishment and life by care;</span>
<span class="line">And what was first but fear what might be done,</span>
<span class="line">Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</span>
<span class="line">And so with me: the great Antiochus,</span>
<span class="line">'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</span>
<span class="line">Since he's so great can make his will his act,</span>
<span class="line">Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</span>
<span class="line">Nor boots it me to say I honour him.</span>
<span class="line">If he suspect I may dishonour him:</span>
<span class="line">And what may make him blush in being known,</span>
<span class="line">He'll stop the course by which it might be known;</span>
<span class="line">With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,</span>
<span class="line">And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</span>
<span class="line">Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</span>
<span class="line">Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,</span>
<span class="line">And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:</span>
<span class="line">Which care of them, not pity of myself,</span>
<span class="line">Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</span>
<span class="line">Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</span>
<span class="line">Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</span>
<span class="line">And punish that before that he would punish.</span>
