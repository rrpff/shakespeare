              <span class="line">Be absolute for death; either death or life</span>
<span class="line">Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</span>
<span class="line">If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</span>
<span class="line">That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</span>
<span class="line">Servile to all the skyey influences,</span>
<span class="line">That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,</span>
<span class="line">Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;</span>
<span class="line">For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun</span>
<span class="line">And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</span>
<span class="line">For all the accommodations that thou bear'st</span>
<span class="line">Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;</span>
<span class="line">For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</span>
<span class="line">Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</span>
<span class="line">And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st</span>
<span class="line">Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</span>
<span class="line">For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains</span>
<span class="line">That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;</span>
<span class="line">For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</span>
<span class="line">And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;</span>
<span class="line">For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</span>
<span class="line">After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;</span>
<span class="line">For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</span>
<span class="line">Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,</span>
<span class="line">And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</span>
<span class="line">For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</span>
<span class="line">The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</span>
<span class="line">Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</span>
<span class="line">For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</span>
<span class="line">But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</span>
<span class="line">Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</span>
<span class="line">Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</span>
<span class="line">Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</span>
<span class="line">Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</span>
<span class="line">To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this</span>
<span class="line">That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</span>
<span class="line">Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</span>
<span class="line">That makes these odds all even.</span>
