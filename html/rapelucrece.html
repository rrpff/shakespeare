<h2>Act 1 Scene 1 &middot; The Argument</h2>

      <section class="dialogue">

            <section class="dialogue__text">
              <span class="line">Lucius Tarquinius, for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus,</span>
<span class="line">after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be</span>
<span class="line">cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs,</span>
<span class="line">not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages, had</span>
<span class="line">possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons</span>
<span class="line">and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege</span>
<span class="line">the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of</span>
<span class="line">Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after</span>
<span class="line">supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife: among</span>
<span class="line">whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife</span>
<span class="line">Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they posted to Rome; and</span>
<span class="line">intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of</span>
<span class="line">that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds</span>
<span class="line">his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her</span>
<span class="line">maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or</span>
<span class="line">in several disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus</span>
<span class="line">the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus</span>
<span class="line">Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty, yet smothering</span>
<span class="line">his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the</span>
<span class="line">camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and</span>
<span class="line">was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by</span>
<span class="line">Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth</span>
<span class="line">into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the</span>
<span class="line">morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight,</span>
<span class="line">hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father,</span>
<span class="line">another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one</span>
<span class="line">accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius;</span>
<span class="line">and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause</span>
<span class="line">of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her</span>
<span class="line">revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and</span>
<span class="line">withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent</span>
<span class="line">they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the</span>
<span class="line">Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted</span>
<span class="line">the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a</span>
<span class="line">bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith the</span>
<span class="line">people were so moved, that with one consent and a general</span>
<span class="line">acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state</span>
<span class="line">government changed from kings to consuls.</span>

<span class="line">Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,</span>
<span class="line">By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.</span>
