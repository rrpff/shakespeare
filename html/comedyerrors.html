              <span class="line">A heavier task could not have been imposed</span>
<span class="line">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</span>
<span class="line">Yet, that the world may witness that my end</span>
<span class="line">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</span>
<span class="line">I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</span>
<span class="line">In Syracusa was I born, and wed</span>
<span class="line">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</span>
<span class="line">And by me, had not our hap been bad.</span>
<span class="line">With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</span>
<span class="line">By prosperous voyages I often made</span>
<span class="line">To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</span>
<span class="line">And the great care of goods at random left</span>
<span class="line">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</span>
<span class="line">From whom my absence was not six months old</span>
<span class="line">Before herself, almost at fainting under</span>
<span class="line">The pleasing punishment that women bear,</span>
<span class="line">Had made provision for her following me</span>
<span class="line">And soon and safe arrived where I was.</span>
<span class="line">There had she not been long, but she became</span>
<span class="line">A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</span>
<span class="line">And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</span>
<span class="line">As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</span>
<span class="line">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</span>
<span class="line">A meaner woman was delivered</span>
<span class="line">Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</span>
<span class="line">Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</span>
<span class="line">I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</span>
<span class="line">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</span>
<span class="line">Made daily motions for our home return:</span>
<span class="line">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</span>
<span class="line">We came aboard.</span>
<span class="line">A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</span>
<span class="line">Before the always wind-obeying deep</span>
<span class="line">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</span>
<span class="line">But longer did we not retain much hope;</span>
<span class="line">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</span>
<span class="line">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</span>
<span class="line">A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</span>
<span class="line">Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</span>
<span class="line">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</span>
<span class="line">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</span>
<span class="line">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</span>
<span class="line">That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</span>
<span class="line">Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</span>
<span class="line">And this it was, for other means was none:</span>
<span class="line">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</span>
<span class="line">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</span>
<span class="line">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</span>
<span class="line">Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</span>
<span class="line">Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</span>
<span class="line">To him one of the other twins was bound,</span>
<span class="line">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</span>
<span class="line">The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</span>
<span class="line">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</span>
<span class="line">Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</span>
<span class="line">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</span>
<span class="line">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</span>
<span class="line">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</span>
<span class="line">Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</span>
<span class="line">And by the benefit of his wished light,</span>
<span class="line">The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</span>
<span class="line">Two ships from far making amain to us,</span>
<span class="line">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</span>
<span class="line">But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</span>
<span class="line">Gather the sequel by that went before.</span>

<span class="line">We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</span>
<span class="line">Which being violently borne upon,</span>
<span class="line">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</span>
<span class="line">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</span>
<span class="line">Fortune had left to both of us alike</span>
<span class="line">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</span>
<span class="line">Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</span>
<span class="line">With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</span>
<span class="line">Was carried with more speed before the wind;</span>
<span class="line">And in our sight they three were taken up</span>
<span class="line">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</span>
<span class="line">At length, another ship had seized on us;</span>
<span class="line">And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</span>
<span class="line">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</span>
<span class="line">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</span>
<span class="line">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</span>
<span class="line">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</span>
<span class="line">Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</span>

              <span class="line">My liege, I am advised what I say,</span>
<span class="line">Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</span>
<span class="line">Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,</span>
<span class="line">Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</span>
<span class="line">This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:</span>
<span class="line">That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,</span>
<span class="line">Could witness it, for he was with me then;</span>
<span class="line">Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</span>
<span class="line">Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</span>
<span class="line">Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</span>
<span class="line">Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</span>
<span class="line">I went to seek him: in the street I met him</span>
<span class="line">And in his company that gentleman.</span>
<span class="line">There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</span>
<span class="line">That I this day of him received the chain,</span>
<span class="line">Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which</span>
<span class="line">He did arrest me with an officer.</span>
<span class="line">I did obey, and sent my peasant home</span>
<span class="line">For certain ducats: he with none return'd</span>
<span class="line">Then fairly I bespoke the officer</span>
<span class="line">To go in person with me to my house.</span>
<span class="line">By the way we met</span>
<span class="line">My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</span>
<span class="line">Of vile confederates. Along with them</span>
<span class="line">They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,</span>
<span class="line">A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</span>
<span class="line">A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</span>
<span class="line">A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</span>
<span class="line">A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,</span>
<span class="line">Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</span>
<span class="line">And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</span>
<span class="line">And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,</span>
<span class="line">Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together</span>
<span class="line">They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence</span>
<span class="line">And in a dark and dankish vault at home</span>
<span class="line">There left me and my man, both bound together;</span>
<span class="line">Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</span>
<span class="line">I gain'd my freedom, and immediately</span>
<span class="line">Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech</span>
<span class="line">To give me ample satisfaction</span>
<span class="line">For these deep shames and great indignities.</span>
