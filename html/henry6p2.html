<span class="line">Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,</span>
<span class="line">To pry into the secrets of the state;</span>
<span class="line">Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,</span>
<span class="line">With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,</span>
<span class="line">And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:</span>
<span class="line">Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</span>

<span class="line">'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:</span>
<span class="line">I take it kindly; and yet be well assured</span>
<span class="line">You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.</span>
<span class="line">Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</span>

<span class="line">Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</span>
<span class="line">And, for a minister of my intent,</span>
<span class="line">I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,</span>
<span class="line">John Cade of Ashford,</span>
<span class="line">To make commotion, as full well he can,</span>
<span class="line">Under the title of John Mortimer.</span>
<span class="line">In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</span>
<span class="line">Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</span>
<span class="line">And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</span>
<span class="line">Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;</span>
<span class="line">And, in the end being rescued, I have seen</span>
<span class="line">Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</span>
<span class="line">Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</span>
<span class="line">Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,</span>
<span class="line">Hath he conversed with the enemy,</span>
<span class="line">And undiscover'd come to me again</span>
<span class="line">And given me notice of their villanies.</span>
<span class="line">This devil here shall be my substitute;</span>
<span class="line">For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</span>
<span class="line">In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:</span>
<span class="line">By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,</span>
<span class="line">How they affect the house and claim of York.</span>
<span class="line">Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,</span>
<span class="line">I know no pain they can inflict upon him</span>
<span class="line">Will make him say I moved him to those arms.</span>
<span class="line">Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,</span>
<span class="line">Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength</span>
<span class="line">And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;</span>
<span class="line">For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</span>
<span class="line">And Henry put apart, the next for me.</span>
