              <span class="line">Think it no more.</span>
<span class="line">For nature crescent does not grow alone</span>
<span class="line">In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,</span>
<span class="line">The inward service of the mind and soul</span>
<span class="line">Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</span>
<span class="line">And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</span>
<span class="line">The virtue of his will; but you must fear,</span>
<span class="line">His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</span>
<span class="line">For he himself is subject to his birth.</span>
<span class="line">He may not, as unvalued persons do,</span>
<span class="line">Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</span>
<span class="line">The safety and health of this whole state,</span>
<span class="line">And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd</span>
<span class="line">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</span>
<span class="line">Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</span>
<span class="line">It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</span>
<span class="line">As he in his particular act and place</span>
<span class="line">May give his saying deed; which is no further</span>
<span class="line">Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</span>
<span class="line">Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain</span>
<span class="line">If with too credent ear you list his songs,</span>
<span class="line">Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</span>
<span class="line">To his unmast'red importunity.</span>
<span class="line">Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</span>
<span class="line">And keep you in the rear of your affection,</span>
<span class="line">Out of the shot and danger of desire.</span>
<span class="line">The chariest maid is prodigal enough</span>
<span class="line">If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</span>
<span class="line">Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.</span>
<span class="line">The canker galls the infants of the spring</span>
<span class="line">Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,</span>
<span class="line">And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</span>
<span class="line">Contagious blastments are most imminent.</span>
<span class="line">Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.</span>
<span class="line">Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</span>

<span class="line">The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks</span>
<span class="line">That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation</span>
<span class="line">Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.</span>
<span class="line">To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!</span>

<span class="line">Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</span>
