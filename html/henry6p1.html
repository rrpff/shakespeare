              <span class="line">O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</span>
<span class="line">The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</span>
<span class="line">The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</span>
<span class="line">Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</span>
<span class="line">Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</span>
<span class="line">By three and twenty thousand of the French</span>
<span class="line">Was round encompassed and set upon.</span>
<span class="line">No leisure had he to enrank his men;</span>
<span class="line">He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</span>
<span class="line">Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</span>
<span class="line">They pitched in the ground confusedly,</span>
<span class="line">To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</span>
<span class="line">More than three hours the fight continued;</span>
<span class="line">Where valiant Talbot above human thought</span>
<span class="line">Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</span>
<span class="line">Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</span>
<span class="line">Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</span>
<span class="line">The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</span>
<span class="line">All the whole army stood agazed on him:</span>
<span class="line">His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</span>
<span class="line">A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</span>
<span class="line">And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</span>
<span class="line">Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</span>
<span class="line">If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</span>
<span class="line">He, being in the vaward, placed behind</span>
<span class="line">With purpose to relieve and follow them,</span>
<span class="line">Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</span>
<span class="line">Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</span>
<span class="line">Enclosed were they with their enemies:</span>
<span class="line">A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</span>
<span class="line">Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</span>
<span class="line">Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</span>
<span class="line">Durst not presume to look once in the face.</span>
