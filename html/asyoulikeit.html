              <span class="line">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed</span>
<span class="line">me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,</span>
<span class="line">charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there</span>
<span class="line">begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</span>
<span class="line">report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me</span>
<span class="line">rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at</span>
<span class="line">home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my</span>
<span class="line">birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are</span>
<span class="line">bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,</span>
<span class="line">they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly</span>
<span class="line">hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for</span>
<span class="line">the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him</span>
<span class="line">as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the</span>
<span class="line">something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from</span>
<span class="line">me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</span>
<span class="line">brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my</span>
<span class="line">education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of</span>
<span class="line">my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against</span>
<span class="line">this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no</span>
<span class="line">wise remedy how to avoid it.</span>

              <span class="line">A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,</span>
<span class="line">A motley fool. A miserable world!</span>
<span class="line">As I do live by food, I met a fool,</span>
<span class="line">Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,</span>
<span class="line">And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,</span>
<span class="line">In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.</span>
<span class="line">'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,</span>
<span class="line">'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'</span>
<span class="line">And then he drew a dial from his poke,</span>
<span class="line">And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</span>
<span class="line">Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;</span>
<span class="line">Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;</span>
<span class="line">'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;</span>
<span class="line">And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</span>
<span class="line">And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</span>
<span class="line">And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</span>
<span class="line">And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear</span>
<span class="line">The motley fool thus moral on the time,</span>
<span class="line">My lungs began to crow like chanticleer</span>
<span class="line">That fools should be so deep contemplative;</span>
<span class="line">And I did laugh sans intermission</span>
<span class="line">An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</span>
<span class="line">A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.</span>

<span class="line">way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge</span>
<span class="line">you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of</span>
<span class="line">this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love</span>
<span class="line">you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you</span>
<span class="line">hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.</span>
<span class="line">If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that</span>
<span class="line">pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied</span>
<span class="line">not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,</span>
<span class="line">or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,</span>
<span class="line">bid me farewell.</span>
