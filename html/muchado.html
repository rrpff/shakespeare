<span class="line">[Exit Boy]</span>
<span class="line">I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</span>
<span class="line">another man is a fool when he dedicates his</span>
<span class="line">behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</span>
<span class="line">such shallow follies in others, become the argument</span>
<span class="line">of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</span>
<span class="line">is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</span>
<span class="line">with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</span>
<span class="line">rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</span>
<span class="line">when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</span>
<span class="line">good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</span>
<span class="line">carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</span>
<span class="line">speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</span>
<span class="line">and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</span>
<span class="line">words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</span>
<span class="line">strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</span>
<span class="line">these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not</span>
<span class="line">be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but</span>
<span class="line">I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster</span>
<span class="line">of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman</span>
<span class="line">is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am</span>
<span class="line">well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all</span>
<span class="line">graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in</span>
<span class="line">my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,</span>
<span class="line">or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;</span>
<span class="line">fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not</span>
<span class="line">near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good</span>
<span class="line">discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall</span>
<span class="line">be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and</span>
<span class="line">Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</span>
