<span class="line">was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a</span>
<span class="line">purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in</span>
<span class="line">chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,</span>
<span class="line">and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this</span>
<span class="line">time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their</span>
