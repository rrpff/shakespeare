<span class="line">the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster</span>

              <span class="line">God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</span>
<span class="line">At thy affections, which do hold a wing</span>
<span class="line">Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</span>
<span class="line">Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</span>
<span class="line">Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</span>
<span class="line">And art almost an alien to the hearts</span>
<span class="line">Of all the court and princes of my blood:</span>
<span class="line">The hope and expectation of thy time</span>
<span class="line">Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</span>
<span class="line">Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</span>
<span class="line">Had I so lavish of my presence been,</span>
<span class="line">So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</span>
<span class="line">So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</span>
<span class="line">Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</span>
<span class="line">Had still kept loyal to possession</span>
<span class="line">And left me in reputeless banishment,</span>
<span class="line">A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</span>
<span class="line">By being seldom seen, I could not stir</span>
<span class="line">But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</span>
<span class="line">That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</span>
<span class="line">Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</span>
<span class="line">And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</span>
<span class="line">And dress'd myself in such humility</span>
<span class="line">That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</span>
<span class="line">Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</span>
<span class="line">Even in the presence of the crowned king.</span>
<span class="line">Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</span>
<span class="line">My presence, like a robe pontifical,</span>
<span class="line">Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</span>
<span class="line">Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</span>
<span class="line">And won by rareness such solemnity.</span>
<span class="line">The skipping king, he ambled up and down</span>
<span class="line">With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</span>
<span class="line">Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</span>
<span class="line">Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</span>
<span class="line">Had his great name profaned with their scorns</span>
<span class="line">And gave his countenance, against his name,</span>
<span class="line">To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</span>
<span class="line">Of every beardless vain comparative,</span>
<span class="line">Grew a companion to the common streets,</span>
<span class="line">Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</span>
<span class="line">That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</span>
<span class="line">They surfeited with honey and began</span>
<span class="line">To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</span>
<span class="line">More than a little is by much too much.</span>
<span class="line">So when he had occasion to be seen,</span>
<span class="line">He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</span>
<span class="line">Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</span>
<span class="line">As, sick and blunted with community,</span>
<span class="line">Afford no extraordinary gaze,</span>
<span class="line">Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</span>
<span class="line">When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</span>
<span class="line">But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</span>
<span class="line">Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</span>
<span class="line">As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</span>
<span class="line">Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</span>
<span class="line">And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</span>
<span class="line">For thou has lost thy princely privilege</span>
<span class="line">With vile participation: not an eye</span>
<span class="line">But is a-weary of thy common sight,</span>
<span class="line">Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</span>
<span class="line">Which now doth that I would not have it do,</span>
<span class="line">Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</span>
