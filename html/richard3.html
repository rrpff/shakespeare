              <span class="line">Now is the winter of our discontent</span>
<span class="line">Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</span>
<span class="line">And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</span>
<span class="line">In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</span>
<span class="line">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</span>
<span class="line">Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</span>
<span class="line">Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</span>
<span class="line">Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</span>
<span class="line">Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</span>
<span class="line">And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</span>
<span class="line">To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</span>
<span class="line">He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</span>
<span class="line">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</span>
<span class="line">But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</span>
<span class="line">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</span>
<span class="line">I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</span>
<span class="line">To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</span>
<span class="line">I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</span>
<span class="line">Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</span>
<span class="line">Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</span>

<span class="line">And that so lamely and unfashionable</span>
<span class="line">That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</span>
<span class="line">Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</span>
<span class="line">Have no delight to pass away the time,</span>
<span class="line">Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</span>
<span class="line">And descant on mine own deformity:</span>
<span class="line">And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</span>
<span class="line">To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</span>
<span class="line">I am determined to prove a villain</span>
<span class="line">And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</span>
<span class="line">Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</span>
<span class="line">By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</span>
<span class="line">To set my brother Clarence and the king</span>
<span class="line">In deadly hate the one against the other:</span>
<span class="line">And if King Edward be as true and just</span>
<span class="line">As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</span>
<span class="line">This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</span>
<span class="line">About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</span>
<span class="line">Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</span>
