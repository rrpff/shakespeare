<span class="line">His coward lips did from their colour fly,</span>
<span class="line">And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</span>
<span class="line">Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</span>
<span class="line">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</span>
<span class="line">Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</span>
<span class="line">Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Tintinius,'</span>

              <span class="line">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</span>
<span class="line">I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</span>
<span class="line">The evil that men do lives after them;</span>
<span class="line">The good is oft interred with their bones;</span>
<span class="line">So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</span>
<span class="line">Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</span>
<span class="line">If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</span>
<span class="line">And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</span>
<span class="line">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</span>
<span class="line">For Brutus is an honourable man;</span>
<span class="line">So are they all, all honourable men--</span>
<span class="line">Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</span>
<span class="line">He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</span>
<span class="line">But Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
<span class="line">And Brutus is an honourable man.</span>
<span class="line">He hath brought many captives home to Rome</span>
<span class="line">Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</span>
<span class="line">Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</span>
<span class="line">When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</span>
<span class="line">Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</span>
<span class="line">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
<span class="line">And Brutus is an honourable man.</span>
<span class="line">You all did see that on the Lupercal</span>
<span class="line">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</span>
<span class="line">Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</span>
<span class="line">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
<span class="line">And, sure, he is an honourable man.</span>
<span class="line">I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</span>
<span class="line">But here I am to speak what I do know.</span>
<span class="line">You all did love him once, not without cause:</span>
<span class="line">What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</span>
<span class="line">O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</span>
<span class="line">And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</span>
<span class="line">My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</span>
<span class="line">And I must pause till it come back to me.</span>

<span class="line">Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</span>
<span class="line">See what a rent the envious Casca made:</span>

<span class="line">Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</span>

<span class="line">Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</span>
<span class="line">Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</span>
<span class="line">And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</span>
<span class="line">Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</span>
