              <span class="line">Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.</span>
<span class="line">You must not now deny it is your hand:</span>
<span class="line">Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;</span>
<span class="line">Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:</span>
<span class="line">You can say none of this: well, grant it then</span>
<span class="line">And tell me, in the modesty of honour,</span>
<span class="line">Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,</span>
<span class="line">Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,</span>
<span class="line">To put on yellow stockings and to frown</span>
<span class="line">Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;</span>
<span class="line">And, acting this in an obedient hope,</span>
<span class="line">Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,</span>
<span class="line">Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</span>
<span class="line">And made the most notorious geck and gull</span>
<span class="line">That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.</span>

              <span class="line">Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</span>
<span class="line">Though, I confess, much like the character</span>
<span class="line">But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.</span>
<span class="line">And now I do bethink me, it was she</span>
<span class="line">First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,</span>
<span class="line">And in such forms which here were presupposed</span>
<span class="line">Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:</span>
<span class="line">This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;</span>
<span class="line">But when we know the grounds and authors of it,</span>
<span class="line">Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</span>
<span class="line">Of thine own cause.</span>

<span class="line">Taint the condition of this present hour,</span>
<span class="line">Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,</span>
<span class="line">Most freely I confess, myself and Toby</span>
<span class="line">Set this device against Malvolio here,</span>
<span class="line">Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</span>
<span class="line">We had conceived against him: Maria writ</span>
<span class="line">The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;</span>
<span class="line">In recompense whereof he hath married her.</span>
<span class="line">How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,</span>
<span class="line">May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;</span>
<span class="line">If that the injuries be justly weigh'd</span>
<span class="line">That have on both sides pass'd.</span>
